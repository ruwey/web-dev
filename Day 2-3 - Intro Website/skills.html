      The activity that I am probably the best at and, certainly, what I have
      spent to most of my spare time doing in the last year is Biking. It is the
      right mix of meditative and exploratory for me to really enjoy it. I also
      find it a great time to listen to books, podcasts, and music as well as
      getting to spots around the city that I would not have found otherwise.

    <h1>Rides I Want to Take</h1>
    <p>
      Over the summer, I road from Munich, Germany to Barcelona, Spain which was
      a lovely way to see the world and quite enjoyable. Here are some other
      places I would like to bike.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>New York to Toronto to Montreal back to New York</li>
      <li>American Coast to Cost</li>
      <li>To Maine and Back</li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
