# Web Design

The Design of a website is quite important as it allows your user to easily
understand the data on a website and get ones message.

# CSS

The language used to _style html_.

## Types of CSS

There are two types of CSS:

- Inline CSS - Directly on a tag
- Embedded CSS - In a `style` tag, separate from main html.
- Linked CSS - Same as Embedded but in a separate file using the `link` tag.
  Looks like: `<link rel=stylesheet href=PATH>` where PATH is the file path.

## Syntax

CSS uses text boxes
